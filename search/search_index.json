These properties can be broadly categorized as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mechanical Properties Definition: Mechanical properties describe how a material responds to forces and loads. These include strength, hardness, toughness, ductility, and elasticity. Example: Steel is strong and tough, making it ideal for construction and bridges.    </p> </li> <li> <p>Chemical Properties Definition: Chemical properties define how a material reacts with other substances, including resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and chemical stability. Example: Stainless steel is highly resistant to rust due to its chromium content.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Electrical Properties Definition: Electrical properties refer to a material\u2019s ability to conduct or resist electrical currents. Important factors include conductivity, resistivity, and dielectric strength. Example: Copper has high electrical conductivity, making it ideal for wiring.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Thermal Properties Definition: Thermal properties describe how a material responds to heat, including conductivity, expansion, and specific heat capacity. Example: Aluminum has high thermal conductivity, making it suitable for heat sinks.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Optical Properties Definition: Optical properties involve how a material interacts with light, including transparency, reflectivity, and refractive index. Example: Glass is transparent, making it useful for windows and lenses.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Magnetic Properties Definition: Magnetic properties describe a material's response to a magnetic field, including ferromagnetism, diamagnetism, and paramagnetism. Example: Iron is ferromagnetic, which makes it useful for electromagnets and transformers.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>The properties of a material determine its usability and engineering applications.
