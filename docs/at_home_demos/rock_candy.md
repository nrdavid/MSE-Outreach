- **Water**  
- **Glass jar** or clear cup (12–16 oz mason jar ideal)  
- **Wooden skewer** or string  
- **Clothespin** or tape (to hold skewer)  
- **Saucepan**

???+ question  
    Why does coating your skewer in sugar help crystals grow faster?

## The Science: Supersaturation & Nucleation

A **supersaturated solution** holds more dissolved solute than it would at room temperature:

1. **Heat** water → solubility ↑ → dissolve extra sugar  
2. **Cool** solution slowly → becomes unstable → sugar exits solution as crystals  


Crystals form on **nucleation sites**—the rough sugar on your skewer is perfect for this!

## Step-by-Step Crystal Craft

### 1. Prepare & Coat Skewer  
- Dip skewer in **water**, then roll in **dry sugar** → let dry 10 min.

### 2. Dissolve the Sugar  
- Boil **1 cup** water in saucepan.  
- Add **3 cups** sugar, one cup at a time, stirring until clear.  
- (Optional) Stir in **food coloring** or **vanilla extract**.

### 3. Cool & Set Up Jar  
- Remove from heat, cool **20 min** to room temperature.  
- Warm your jar with hot tap water → pour in cooled solution.  
- Suspend skewer 1″ from the bottom, secure with clothespin.

### 4. Grow Your Crystals  
- Cover jar loosely (plastic wrap or towel).  
- **Wait 5–7 days**, checking daily for formation.  
- If no crystals after 24 h → reheat solution, add extra sugar, reset.

???+ question  
    How does the cooling rate affect crystal size and clarity?

## Variations & Design Challenges

- **Color & flavor**: Try different extracts or layered colors.  
- **Crystal size**: Use slower cooling (ice bath vs. room temperature).  
- **Nucleation patterns**: Twist pipe cleaners or use textured string.

???+ challenge  
    Design a gradient rock candy: firmer crystals at the bottom, finer at the top. How would you adjust concentration or temperature?
