## Overview

In this demo, students will learn about hydrogels- and make their very own! 

## Supplies

In this lab, we will use solutions of two common materials: sodium alginate and calcium chloride. Sodium alginate is a polymer that comes from seaweed and is used by algae to support its cell walls. Sodium alginate is commonly used in food, medicine, and to make hydrogels! Calcium chloride is a salt often used to melt ice on roads in the winter.

- Calcium Chloride (powder, such as [this](https://a.co/d/blizopW))
- Sodium alginate (powder, such as [this](https://a.co/d/0TCGLwl))
- two large glass containers
- food coloring
- small plastic cups or sauce containers
- plastic spoons
- plastic pipettes or syringes
- paper towels

## Preparing the solutions

Sodium Alginate Solution
Combine 10 grams of sodium alginate (3-5 grams at a time) per 500mL of hot distilled water until dissolved. Add water to 1L total and stir overnight (1% w/v). Add any food coloring that you would like!

Calcium Chloride Solution
Combine 11.1g CaCl2 in 500mL of distilled water and stir until dissolved. Add water to 2L total (stock of 0.05M). [This will be relatively quick]

## Make hyrogel art! 
1. Give each student a cup of clear Calcium Chloride solution, a cup of colored Sodium Alginate solution, a pipette or syringe, and a spoon.
2. Using the pipette (or syringe), draw up the sodium alginate (colored) and inject drops, lines, or shapes of sodium alginate mixture into the calcium chloride cup. 
3. Wait 30 seconds for hydrogels to form.
4. Using a spoon, gently scoop out your hydrogel shapes from the bath and place into your empty container.
5. Arrange your hydrogel shapes into a work of art!

## Critical Thinking Questions
1. How could we change how hard or soft our hydrogel is?
2. What happens when you push or squeeze hydrogel very hard? What if you push softly?
3. How could you use hydrogels in your everyday life?
4. What are some useful properties of this hydrogel?
5. What are some applications where you think hydrogels may be useful?
