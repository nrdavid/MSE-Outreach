# Crystal Growth: From Supersaturated to Sparkling

In this demo, you‚Äôll learn why crystals form, how to grow your own in fun shapes, and why crystallization matters in materials science and engineering.

---

## What You‚Äôll Learn
- The difference between **saturated**, **unsaturated**, and **supersaturated** solutions  
- How **temperature** affects solubility and drives crystal growth  
- Hands-on: making vibrant pipe-cleaner crystals  
- Real-world exothermic crystallization (hand warmers!)  
- How MSE researchers control crystal structure for advanced materials  

---

## Supplies Checklist
- **Magnesium sulfate** (Epsom salt) or **table sugar**  
- **Hot water** (near boiling)  
- **Beakers** or clear jars  
- **Food coloring** (optional)  
- **Pipe cleaners** (shaped into fun forms)  
- **String** or thread  
- **Sodium acetate** solution (for hand-warmer demo)  
- **Thermometer** (optional)

    Why can hot water dissolve more salt than cold water?

## Solubility & Supersaturation

A **solubility curve** shows how much solute water can hold at different temperatures. To grow crystals:
1. Heat water and **dissolve** as much solute as possible ‚Üí **supersaturated**.  
2. **Cool** slowly ‚Üí excess solute comes out of solution as **crystals**.

???+ question  
    What happens if you cool too quickly or disturb the solution?

## Step-by-Step Crystal Growing

### Step 1: Prepare Supersaturated Solution
- Heat **250 mL** water to ~80 ¬∞C.  
- Gradually stir in **50 g** Epsom salt until no more dissolves.

### Step 2: Color & Shape
- Add **food coloring** for vibrant crystals.  
- Twist a **pipe cleaner** into a star, heart, or geometric shape. Tie it to a string.

### Step 3: Grow Crystals
- Lower the pipe cleaner into the jar; leave undisturbed.  
- Wait **1‚Äì2 hours** (or overnight) for crystals to form.

???+ question  
    How does the shape of the pipe cleaner affect crystal growth patterns?

## Exothermic Crystallization: Hand Warmers

Some crystals release heat when they form (exothermic). Sodium acetate ‚Äúhand warmers‚Äù use this principle:

### Quick Demo:
1. **Supersaturated** sodium acetate solution in a pouch.  
2. **Click** metal disk ‚Üí triggers rapid crystallization ‚Üí **heat** released!  

???+ question  
    Why does crystallization release heat for sodium acetate but absorb heat for Epsom salt?

## üî¨ Microscopic vs. Macroscopic Crystals

- **Microscopic**: orderly lattice at the nanoscale  
- **Macroscopic**: visible facets and shapes

## Think & Discuss
- What factors (temperature, impurities, agitation) control crystal size and shape?  
- How do engineers use crystal growth to create semiconductors, photovoltaics, or pharmaceutical drugs?

## MSE Research Spotlight


At Michigan, MSE students explore:
- **Bulk crystal growth** for turbine blades (superalloys)  
- **Thin-film crystallization** in solar cells  
- **Protein crystallography** in biomaterials  

---

## Design Challenge

Can you engineer a **gradient supersaturation** to grow graded crystals (small ‚Üí large)?  
- Vary cooling rate along the length of the tube  
- Record crystal size vs. position  

???+ reflection  
    How might graded crystals improve real-world device performance?

## Summary

- You made and observed crystals from supersaturated solutions.  
- You saw exothermic vs. endothermic crystallization.  
- You connected classroom experiments to cutting-edge MSE research.
